# Welcome to the React Native Toast
## Hey! üöÄ

Thank you for exploring my interpretation and custom implementation of a React Native Toast component. My aim was to craft a toast that embodies a modern, minimalistic aesthetic, seamlessly incorporating animations (lotties) for a refined user experience.

## The Vision
While acknowledging the existence of excellent React Native toast libraries, I embarked on creating my own to fulfill a specific vision of a more native look and feel.

## Toast Elegance
I wanted this toast module to be elegant, and something interesting to look at, rather than something that users immediately swipe away (they can if they want to).

## Future Plans for Toast Excellence
Although right now this is more of a proof of concept, I plan to expand on this project and add more features, such as:
- Deploying to npm
- Adding more animations & custom animation support
- More configurations for toast positioning, time to open
- And much more!

## Behind the Scenes
For those keen on implementing a similar concept in your projects, I've documented the intricacies in a comprehensive Medium article. Dive into the details, understanding the construction process from line to line. üçû‚ú®
